# React slider 
In this tutorial we build img slider as a react component

We don't want to specify fixed width and height inside of our slider.User must provide width and height.  

when to use backgroundImage vs img tag ?
with img the image will stretch but with backgroundImage the image will cover as we provide backgroundSize=cover. 
but it can be solved by using object-fit:cover in img tag styles
